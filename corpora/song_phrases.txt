I made it
how you like that
I'll kiss you goodbye
Baby you deserve a treat
getting all these racks I go ballin
best make me believe it 
first, you gotta forgive me
day to night to morning keep me in the moment 
why don't you say so?
you got to keep me focused
I'd let you had I known it
You want it, say so?
Tell me what I must to 
You know I'm your type, right?
Boy, we gon's roll up, we gon' roll out, look
I don't stop for no one but I pause for you
Leave all of your inhibitions behind
how far out does the indigo go?
Know you like little attitude 
So shut up and hop in, we gon'ride in style 
all years 
so let's drive by the city skyline
tonight let's test all the borderlines like 
Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter 
heart full of equity, you're an asset 
When I create, you're my muse
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse
Act like you know that you are 
Shower you will all my attention 
mind your business
best thing
when I'm underneath the bright lights 
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
cold heart
I'm over you
don't call me up
tryna hit me up again
game 
don't wanna talk about us
gotta leave it behind
tell em I've arrived, yeah
took forever and a day, yeah
I ain't never know a feeling this good 
being bad never looked or felt better 
Addicted to Chanel, I'm in love with Coco
Feeling so alive yeah
Hold up, don't question me, my destinty, I manifested
when I pull up 
Movein fast 'cause uber on the way 
I look like bae
we ain't out here looking for boo
it's a homies only kind of mood
no drama, no baby mamas, keepin it cute 
and that's just how we do it
keep stunting on your enemies
baby
You been switching up on me 
you don't need to call anymore
anymore
you were like a drug, had me wavy
I'm gon' keep you until the morning 
Feenin' for attention in the open 
All caught up in emotion 
Got a sweet tooth for me 
Cause my love is just like candy
You know my love's sweet just like candy
I got you trippin on a high
Before you a get a boyfriend 
It's getting out of control 
While you start to dance 
I'm so selfish, I can't help it
I need you all to myself
cause can't nobody else give it to you like that 
Before I knew your maiden name 
You already got me that thing for forever
I wish we didn't make love first 
Let me hit it like the first night 
Plot twist, I never thought it would end up like this?
Ima tell you the truth 
not like these girs on the loose 
I put up with you babe
there's some things I won't take 
you're making me so high now 
you're everything I'd ever want 
you're keeping me so dry now 
baby powder 
I've been all in my phone, I got options
Somethin that makes me look at you too often 
crazy
I need you right in my space 
I think I'm bad as hell
I got issues
forgive as much as you hate 
money help me get by 
buy myself a diamond ring 
still ain't got no lover 
it's hard to trust the things that we lust 
so outta touch 
all of your racks and things 
they don't relax your pain 
bands 
ball 
I shoulda known better 
can't even pretend like I don't want it again
I don't want no one else around 
come through 
look at what you make me wanna do 
Who here gon' sacrifice?
Don't know exactly what you want here 
But it's loving that is the hardest 
always say that it's love 
play too much 
I'm good by myself 
don't need no one elese 
I pose and take pictures then send them 
the best things in life are already mine 
I'm tight 
in your feelings 
don't make me feel a way 
tell me I'm bein irrational
let's just play dumb 
let's do it right 
hard to keep em tuned 
gettin all comfortable 
inevitable
I wanna do this the right way
pretty face
heartbreak
I need you to show me Somethin
I've been tired of waiting 
He wants the white in his nose and cough cough 
tough luck
we want the whole thing 
wet bodies 
blue light 
you want the world?
then I'll give it to you 
I'll steal it for you 
I'm way too cold to stay outside 
You ready for this crime babe?
So can we wait till I'm grown?
40 up 40 down down
21, I'm browsin
I want you 
but loving who I want seems impossible these days 
if you believed in us 
You make feel like 1974 live
You could be my favorite love long 
sugar
24 hours

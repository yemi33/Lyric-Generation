# Lyric-Generation

## Introduction
This is a program that sources words and phrases from popular songs and mash them up in the format of lyrics! This was part of my Midterm project for Computational Media course at Carleton college. 

## How to Run the Program
1. Navigate to `Lyric-Generation` folder.
2. Type `python3 main.py` on the command line.
3. See what lyrics my program generates, and sing it on some beat!
